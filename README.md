# READ BEFORE SUBSCRIBING

This addon is a complete *fork and overhaul* of the original BSMod.  
It removes unused/buggy features, improves stability, updates internal systems, and adds brand-new functionality — all while keeping the core killmove experience intact.

**This is NOT the original BSMod addon.**  
It is a modernized remake focused on smoother gameplay, better usability, cleaner code, and new features.

**To bind a key to killmove:**  
bind k bsmod_killmove


**Works with ALL Custom KillMoves.**

## ⚠ DO NOT USE THIS WITH THE ORIGINAL BSMod INSTALLED. ⚠
They will conflict. Some other mods may also interfere with features.

## Q&A

- **"What makes this better than BSMOD Killmoves Rewritten | FARCRY?"**  
  That addon attempts to replicate the idea, but the execution is poor. This version provides a more polished system with multiple expanded features rather than relying on a single mechanic.

- **"Why can I not killmove???"**  
  Probably because you didn't stay in school long enough. 😅

- **"Why is the FOV messed up when I killmove?"**  
  It's your weapon/tool conflicting with the FOV. I haven't found a universal solution, so it may not be my mod causing the problem.  

Please bear with me. I'm adding as much as I can as fast as I can. If there's something you don't like about the mod, feedback is welcome.  

This fork also includes a deep internal cleanup to improve stability, remove legacy issues, and modernize the system overall. Bugs may still occur, but updates will continue as time allows.

## About This Version

This version **removes the kick and punch system**, entirely focusing the addon purely on killmoves and polish.  
The goal is to provide a cleaner, more stable, and consistent experience than the original. The intention is to make killmoves behave similarly to the FarCry game's system.
